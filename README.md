# HackTU

## Description
This is a song recognition app wherein you type something about the song you want to search for and you get eight songs complying to your details.
This project was made at a hackathon organised in my college named HackTU.

## Basic Working
The root route of this webapp renders a page with a searchbar and a search button which makes a get request to the genius api, which we found on rapid api hub.
From the api we get an array of some similar songs, which we display using ejs technology.

## My Contributions
I made the api calls work and also structured the backend of the project.

## Future Endeavours 
We integrate a user interface into the project using which we would be able to keep a track of our users and potentially integrate google ads for revenue.
